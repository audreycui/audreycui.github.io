                        My intro media studies (CMS.100) professor is a firm believer in “a picture is worth a thousand words,” so he let us create any form of media for our final project. I chose to create a zine about Zoom and its media affordances (or the lack thereof). 
                        <br><br>
                        The term ‘zine’ comes from the shortened syllable of magazine, as it’s often a collection of images and words. Zines can refer to any self published pamphlet. I think that’s where the charm of zines come from — they’re supposed to look handmade, self published, DIY’ed, a raw distillation of one’s ideas and experiences and stories onto paper. Zoom was one of the defining experiences of this year, making me feel connected with friends from thousands of miles away at times yet hopelessly isolated at other times. 
                        <br><br>
                        <img style="display: block; width: 30%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="zoomzine/zine1.png">
                        <br><br>    
                        My zine is titled “My 2D Existence.” To many of the people I’ve met this year, my physical existence is confined to a 2D rectangle. Conversely, these people are confined to a similar physical 2D existence to my eyes. But metaphorically speaking, people can’t be confined to only two dimensions, or even three for that matter. People are wonderfully multifaceted, and I feel like I’ve gotten to know multiple dimensions of the people I’ve become closest to. Or have I? What if when I finally meet people in real life, I realize that I didn’t get to know them in any dimension at all? I don’t normally fear this, but this thought creeps into my mind when I’m feeling the most alone. 
                        <br><br>

                        Breakout rooms… this term is quite loaded. When everyone’s mics/cameras are turned off in a breakout room, it feels like being confined in a small room with faceless strangers. I’m surprised that how out of all the human emotions/interactions, awkwardness and uncomfortableness translate so easily onto a virtual platform. Thankfully my media studies classmates are pretty good about making an effort to engage, and our discussions are usually a fun time. But even when people are making an effort to engage, awkwardness is inevitable when everyone’s staring at the screen blank eyed wondering if someone else is going to speak first, when two people start talking at the same time and Zoom makes both sound jumbled. I also miss small group discussions in a physical classroom. Breakout rooms make the discussion feel isolated from the rest of the class, without the background noise and occasional cross pollination of ideas between groups that you get in a physical classroom. 
                        <br><br>

                        This was inspired by something my prof brought up early in the semester: the idea that you can’t make eye contact on Zoom. You can stare at someone’s Zoom rectangle, but they won’t know that. Eye contact is a form of acknowledgement that you see them in both the literal sense and the metaphorical sense. Metaphorical sense as in letting someone know that their existence matters to you. I guess in real life, the disconnect from lack of eye contact isn’t so intense as I make it sound like. But I suppose my melodramatic verbalization of that abstract feeling comes from the human desire to be seen, to feel mattered. 
                        <br><br>

                        <br><br>
                        The next two pages are a continuation of the ideas from the eye contact page. In a physical classroom, you can turn to face a desk partner to have a conversation. On Zoom no one logically turns their head to face someone in an adjacent rectangle, but illustrating that situation captures the disconnect of virtual conversations. If someone did turn their head, it’s possible that the person is facing the wrong way on someone else’s screen. 
                        <br><br>

                        <br><br>
                        My friend was telling me about how virtual interaction adds an extra layer of activation energy. In real life, you can randomly bump into people and a conversation blossoms on the spot. But the added steps of having to schedule a time to Zoom and even having to reach out to people makes it so every interaction is deliberate and nonspontaneous. Generally, reaching out to people when I feel like talking isn’t too big of a deal. But periodically, I fall into lapses of loneliness where I want someone to talk with, but paradoxically don’t have the social energy to reach out.

                        Ah yes this page. I don’t know exactly what was going on in my head when I drew this, but it was quite the chaotic mess of ideas that eventually became… something. I was thinking about a video my friend showed me about anime youtubers. They’d create a 3D model of an anime persona that interacts with the world through youtube videos. That reminded me of our discussion of Hatsune Miku in CMS.100 — she’s a projected hologram but has a very real and alive following of fans that listen to her music, attend her live concerts, etc. I logically know that my profs and classmates aren’t anime 3D models or holograms, but… what if they were? They could be, considering that I’m just staring at moving figures across a screen. That sounds dehumanizing, but it’s also hilarious entertaining the idea of one of my profs being Sailor Moon and teaching us graph theory. Portraying my prof as Sailor Moon was a deliberate choice. She undergoes this spectacular transformation sequence, which I found fitting to how my profs had to ‘spectacularly transform’ their curriculum to work in a virtual format. 
                        <br><br>
                        In a way, everyone had to undergo their own transformation to make the most out of this virtual semester. Most of my zine focused on the negative media affordances of Zoom, since that’s what people find the most relatable. I believe that being able to connect with someone involves finding shared experiences and being reassured that you’re not alone in feeling a certain way. However, I’m glad that I could end my zine on a positive, lighthearted note. It reminded me of the creative ways that my profs and friends actually took advantage of Zoom’s affordances, like with fun virtual backgrounds. 
                        <br><br>
                        Mad props to my media studies prof for giving us so much creative freedom with this final project, which also included a presentation. I loved being able to see/listen to the artwork, short stories, podcasts, and interpretive food(!) that my classmates created. A traditional final project for this class probably would’ve been an essay, but you can’t exactly share essays in as engaging of a way. I’m so thankful to have had a prof that values creating community and connection during this physically distanced time.
