                    <p>
                        Warning lots of spoilers ahead!
                        <br><br>
                        After I finished all my finals, I decided to venture into the world of kdrama for the first time by watching Startup. As its name suggests, Startup dramatizes the hopes and dreams, trials and tribulations of the startup world, with a healthy dose of love triangle and estranged family drama. 
                        <br><br>
                        While I felt like the show’s writing was lacking in some places, it was still enjoyable, especially for my post-semester brain that has descended into a state of spaghetti. While I do believe in remaining present and grounded, it was nice to float away with the protagonists’ dramatic rooftop kisses and into the dreamy cityscape lined sky for a brief moment. The idealistic pastel Kdrama world where a melodramatic soundtrack plays anytime something emotional happens felt so far detached from the reality of our current world. 
                        <br><br>
                        It was also interesting to see how computer science would be romanticized in a pop culture context. As expected, there would be lots of fancy ‘hackerman’ looking terminal windows in the developer bros’ desktops, and little of testing and debugging and troubleshooting that take up more time than the actual coding. My friend actually zoomed into the developer’s desktop during a hackathon scene. They were supposed to be developing a handwriting forgery classifier, but the screen actually had the starter code for this iris flower classification model. I found that hilarious and heartwarmingly nostalgic since the iris model tutorial was what got me into machine learning.  
                        <br><br>
                        After watching the show and snapping my head out of the idealistic dreamy kdrama world, I decided to compile (more like braindump) my random thoughts about this show. 
                        <br><br>
                        <b>my HOT takes tldr;</b>
                        <br>
                        1) Nam Do-san (tech bro) is a better match for Seo Dal-mi over Han Ji-Pyeong (VC dude). BUT Ji-pyeong is the better character and deserves a better ending. 
                        <br>
                        2) In-jae is the best character and had a beautifully written redemption arc. 
                        <br>
                        3) Startup’s biggest flaw is how it normalizes workplace harassment.
                        <br><br>
                        <b class='nametext2'>1. good boy vs big hands</b>
                        <br><br>
                        It seems like basically the entire Internet disagrees with me on this, but I liked Dal-mi and Do-san being endgame over Ji-pyeong. Because of the power imbalance he had over her as a mentor, Ji-pyeong’s attraction towards Dal-mi rubbed me in the wrong way. You don’t have much control over who you’re attracted to, so I can’t blame Ji-pyeong entirely, but it just seemed wrong for him to interfere on the basis of his feelings when he has so much control over Dal-mi’s (and Do-san’s) startup. 
                        <br><br>
                        I also disagree with the stance that Ji-pyeong had more romantic chemistry with Dal-mi than Do-san. Like yea some of Do-san’s advances were a little awkward, but how smooth can you be when you spend 90% of your waking hours coding? The awkwardness and fidgeting from Do-san makes him seem like a realistic CS bro who’s trying his best to up his social game. Furthermore, Do-san shares Dal-mi’s aspirations to make the world a better place and uses his technical skills to make her ideas a reality. The two already have a strong working relationship where they complement each other as equals, and that in my opinion translates into a healthy romantic relationship. Ji-pyeong’s mentorship relationship with Dal-mi was strong, but I think that translates into an unbalanced dynamic in a romantic context. If I fell asleep in a mentor’s car and they just watched me sleep for hours instead of waking me up, I would find that way more creepy than endearing. 
                        <br><br>
                        However, who’s a better match for Dal-mi is a separate question from who’s the better character. Both Ji-pyeong and Do-san screwed up, but Ji-pyeong redeemed himself again and again whereas Do-san faced few consequences for his screwups. Ji-pyeong had multiple crossroads that forced him to decide between acting on what’s good for the people he’s mentoring vs what’s going to improve his chances with Dal-mi, and made the selfless decision every time. He’s also had opportunities to throw Do-san under the bus for the times he screwed up but didn’t. While I preferred that Do-san ended up with Dal-mi, I really wished that he could’ve redeemed himself first or gone through a trial that forced him to act selflessly for once. Ji-pyeong grew in so many different ways: learning kindness/empathy, being a compassionate yet constructive mentor, realizing that he can leverage his power to do social good, selflessly sacrificing his hopes to be with Dal-mi, every interaction with Halmoni, the list goes on. I felt like the only way Do-san grew was that he had to grapple with being a child prodigy who initially failed in the eyes of his family/society and learned how to say cute metaphors to Dal-mi. I think it’s implied through the ending that Ji-pyeong found fulfillment and true happiness through the orphan mentorship startup, but ultimately he deserves romantic love. It’s sad that Ji-pyeong only shares his beautifully furnished yet eerily lonely apartment with his robot voice assistant.

                        <b class='nametext2'>2. In-jae’s redemption arc</b>
                        
                        <br><br>
                        Other than Startup, Avatar the Last Airbender is the only other show that I’ve dedicated myself to watching and finishing. Zuko was my favorite from that show not only because he’s hot, but also because of how well written his redemption arc was. 
                        <br><br>
                        In-jae’s redemption arc reminded me of that of Zuko’s right from the get go, so she instantly became one of my favorite characters. While I liked her as a character, I would hate to be like her initial self as a person. She is impressively cunning and calculating (like Azula!), but uses her intelligence to belittle and degrade her sister and basically anyone she saw as inferior. She’s the epitome of what you’d call a business snake. As a result, she begins the series with few actually genuine relationships with other characters. 
                        <br><br>
                        In-jae is initially proud of being her rich stepfather’s adopted child and of the status that comes with it. That is, until she realizes that he used her as a pawn to advance his biological son’s power. This move parallels Ozai scarring Zuko’s eye; the first major blow. (oof I don’t remember his name because he was that despicable, so I’ll just keep calling him ‘the stepfather’). Like Ozai, the stepfather has little actual love or regard for In-jae as his child. Attaining wealth and material success becomes In-jae’s equivalent of capturing the avatar.  In-jae realizes this and is determined to start her own company without leeching off of her father’s connections and wealth, similar to how Zuko realizes that he has to pave his own path and do what he thinks is right. 
                        <br><br>
                        But unlearning what you’ve been conditioned to know since childhood isn’t easy — for the first half of the series, In-jae is extremely condescending and classist towards Dal-mi, weaponizes Dal-mi’s trauma over her father’s death to insult her, and passes off Dal-mi’s precious memory with her father as In-jae’s own for her benefit. However, In-jae gradually realizes that her true motivation for starting her company goes beyond wanting to attribute her success to herself rather than her rich stepfather. Her stepfather has instilled the idea of prioritizing wealth and material success over all, including doing what’s ethical for the world and her relationships with her sister and grandmother, and In-jae realizes that this is wrong. Running her own startup becomes In-jae’s chance to look deeply within herself and reexamine her priorities.
                        <br><br>
                        In-jae comes to see how intelligent Dal-mi is, and recruits her. Initially she sees them working together rather than against each other as something that’ll benefit the company, but I think it’s implied that she later realized that it’s for the good of repairing their broken relationship too. For the first time in a while, In-jae gains a genuine relationship. Zuko comes to a similar realization that his destiny is to help (not kill) the avatar, and makes real friends for the first time. In-jae further redeems herself by dissolving her stepfather’s adoption and taking her biological father’s last name. 
                        <br><br>
                        Zuko’s redemption arc isn’t linear and despite wanting to be the good person Iroh believes that he can be, Zuko betrays Iroh. Hard. Yet when Zuko comes back to Iroh begging for forgiveness, Iroh forgives him on the spot without a second thought out of his unconditional love. When In-jae comes back to her grandmother for the first time in years, In-jae feels immense shame and regret. However, her grandmother doesn’t reprimand her at all and immediately pulls her in for a hug, completing In-jae’s redemption arc. 
                        <br><br>
                        Overall, I like In-jae and her redemption arc significantly more than either male lead and their love triangle. In-jae had serious flaws, but grew in wonderful and important ways without sacrificing her intelligence and ambition, which leaves me satisfied. 
                        <br><br>
                        <b class='nametext2'>3. the normalization of harassment</b>
                        
                        <br><br>
                        Okayyy this one is a little loaded. I really do not like how Chul-san (creepy simp) and Sa-ha (hot designer girl) got together. Chul-san was an absolute creep who wouldn’t back down despite Sa-ha (seemingly) rejecting his advances repeatedly. It’s a very uncomfortable situation to be in under any context, and probably more so when it’s happening in the workplace. It 100% crosses the line for me. However, it’s portrayed more as awkward-but-cute comic relief rather than harassment that Is Not Okay, which upsets me. 
                        <br><br>
                        What’s even worse is that Sa-ha admits that she has feelings for Chul-san all that time and the two get together. That sends the message that no matter now often someone says no, you should disrespect their boundaries and keep trying until they say yes. That also sends the message that it’s okay/cute to manipulate someone’s feelings to ‘be cool’. Like yes it’s nice that the stereotypical CS bro with questionable social skills is still able to get the hot girl, but it didn’t have to be done in such a way that normalizes harassment. 
                        <br><br>
                        Another very off putting scene was that even though Dal-mi asked Do-san to leave her alone, Do-san secretly follows her to a bar and listens in on her conversation. Um isn’t that stalking? That is not romantic at all, but it was somewhat portrayed as so. Do-san gets away with this with zero consequences, which sends the message that you don’t have to back off when someone tells you to. Honestly I’m surprised that Dal-mi dealt with Do-san and Ji-pyeong’s advances with so much grace and patience and rarely openly expressed her (justifiable) discomfort. 
                        <br><br>
                        And that concludes my hot takes!
